# Orders Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts the number of orders based on various factors such as store type, location type, discount availability, and whether a holiday is occurring. The model is built using LightGBM, a powerful machine learning algorithm, and leverages data visualization techniques to analyze the dataset before training the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- plotly
- scikit-learn
- lightgbm

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to install the required libraries. Run the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn lightgbm
```

## Dataset

The project uses a CSV file named `supplement.csv`. Ensure that the file is present in the project directory before running the script.

## Project Structure

```

## Script Breakdown

### 1. Data Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded using pandas, and an initial exploration is done to check for missing values and summarize the data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

dataset = pd.read_csv("supplement.csv")
dataset.info()
dataset.isnull().sum()
dataset.describe()
```

### 2. Data Visualization

The data is visualized using `plotly` to create pie charts that display the distribution of store types, location types, discount availability, and holidays.

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Visualize Store_Type distribution
pie1 = dataset["Store_Type"].value_counts()
fig = px.pie(dataset, values=pie1.values, names=pie1.index)
fig.show()
```

### 3. Data Transformation

The categorical columns like "Store_Type", "Location_Type", and "Discount" are mapped to numerical values for model training.

```python
dataset["Discount"] = dataset["Discount"].map({"No": 0 , "Yes":1})
dataset["Store_Type"] = dataset["Store_Type"].map({"S1": 1 , "S2":2 , "S3":3 , "S4":4})
dataset["Location_Type"] = dataset["Location_Type"].map({"L1": 1 , "L2":2 , "L3":3 , "L4":4 , "L5":5})
```

### 4. Model Training

The model is trained using LightGBM to predict the number of orders. The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import lightgbm as ltb

X = np.array(dataset[["Store_Type","Location_Type", "Holiday", "Discount"]])
y = np.array(dataset["#Order"])

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = ltb.LGBMRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 5. Predictions

After training the model, predictions are made on the test set, and the results are displayed in a DataFrame.

```python
data = pd.DataFrame(data={"Predicted Orders": y_pred.flatten()})
```

## Conclusion

The project successfully builds a predictive model for estimating the number of orders based on factors such as store type, location, discount, and holidays. By visualizing the dataset, transforming categorical data into numerical values, and training the model using LightGBM, the predictions can be used for strategic decision-making.
